Kieran's other works include Igby Goes Down, The Mighty, Lymelife and Paper Man. In the film Wallace exhibits the uncanny ability to text information at high speed, informing Stacey about Scott's dating problems in an instant, even while barely conscious. He also eavesdrops on Scott's phone conversations on occasion. He does not train Scott or prepare Intel on his roommate's potential adversaries, but rather provides emotional support and advice from the sidelines, comforting Scott when his problems become difficult.</p>

        <p>Knives Chau is played by Ellen Wong whose previous works include roles in Runaway and This is Wonderland. She tried out three times, and director Edgar Wright later found out after the second audition that she was a green belt in tae-kwon-do. They brought her back in, got her to do some high kicks and the like, and cast her in the role.
In the film Wallace and Stacey refer to Knives as Scott's "fake high-school girlfriend" like Wallace did in the books. The only things they do during their time together are playing Ninja Ninja Revolution, visiting the music store Sonic Boom, getting pizza from Pizza Pizza and shopping for clothes at a Goodwill. After Scott breaks up with her, Knives goes on a conquest to win Scott back by being like Ramona and goes as far as to dye half of her hair blue</p>

While he plays a minor role in the film, he spends his time in music gigs worrying about how much his band will be AWESOME or HORRIBLY SUCK to the point Scott gets fed up with his crying and slaps Stills so he can relax (three times: slaps him once when they are about to perform in the Battle of the Bands, and twice in a row when they are about to do the music battle with the Twins). </p>

        <p>Kim is played by Alison Pill whose previous works include roles in Milk, Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen, and Dan in Real Life. Pill also provides the voice of Kim in the animated short Scott Pilgrim vs. The Animation which details her first meeting with Scott, his rescuing her from Simon Lee, and their brief relationship in high school. In the film Kim's wounded feelings concerning Scott are more emphasized and her sarcastic comments are largely directed at him. Unlike the comic or game, Kim is never really seen in a relationship with Knives Chau, and only talks to her a few times.</p>
